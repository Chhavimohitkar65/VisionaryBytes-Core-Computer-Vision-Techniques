This repository contains several Jupyter Notebook files demonstrating various image processing techniques. Each notebook focuses on a specific topic and provides step-by-step explanations and code examples.

Contents:
1. cannyEdgeDetection.ipynb: This notebook demonstrates the Canny edge detection algorithm,
   a popular technique for detecting edges in images.

3. harrisCornerDetection.ipynb: In this notebook, you will learn about Harris corner detection,
    a method used to identify important features or corners in an image.

5. imgFlipping.ipynb: The notebook explores image-flipping techniques,
   including horizontal and vertical flipping, using various image-processing libraries.

7. img_contrastReduction.ipynb: This notebook focuses on reducing the contrast of an image,
    which can be useful in certain applications such as medical imaging or enhancing 
   specific image details.

9. img_enhancement.ipynb: Here, you will find techniques to enhance the overall
     quality of an image by adjusting brightness, contrast, and other parameters.

11. img_processing.ipynb: This notebook serves as a general introduction to image processing,
     covering essential concepts, image manipulation, and basic operations.
